Used almost all of the SSDTs from [PurpleCrumpet's project](https://github.com/PurpleCrumpets/Hackintosh-Dell-Latitude-7390-2-in-1-OpenCore-EFI) (except SSDT-PLUG) and a couple of kexts was updated for OpenCore ```1.0.5``` EFI, this project was for MacOS Sonoma ```14.7.6```.

## What Works

- Sleep (sleep works only when the lid was open)
- MicroSD card reader
- All USB ports (i don't know about Thunderbolt 3 because i don't have any Thunderbolt device)
- HDMI
- Webcam
- Touchpad (touchpad buttons can only be used for 1 button purpose) 
- Touchscreen (works as a giant touchpad)
- Pen support (?) (i don't have any Wacom stylus so i'm not sure)
- Keyboard
- iMessage and Facetime works (but you have to add your own SMBIOS from [here](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-laptop.plist/kaby-lake.html#platforminfo)
- Wifi and Bluetooth (Bluetooth were a bit picky to some devices)
- Apple Audio DRM (Apple Music)
- Brightness functions (Fn + Arrow up/down) thanks to [@superguyadi](https://github.com/superguyadi)'s [tips](https://github.com/PurpleCrumpets/Hackintosh-Dell-Latitude-7390-2-in-1-OpenCore-EFI/issues/3)
- Airdrop, Airplay (only 1 way) thanks to [@randomappleboi](https://github.com/randomappleboi)'s guide [here](https://github.com/randomappleboi/Native-Wifi-for-Hackintoshes-with-Intel-Wireless-cards-on-macOS-sequoia)

## What Doesn't Work
- Wake from hibernate (closed lid)
- Apple Video DRM (Apple TV+,...)
